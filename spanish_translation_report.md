# Spanish Version Audit Report: Border Trade Logistics Website

This report summarizes a comprehensive audit of the **Spanish version** of the McAllen Industrial District property page on the Lovable platform. It identifies which sections are fully translated and accurate, and which still contain English text or outdated figures. All numbers are checked against the correct portfolio totals (43.17 acres, 702,820 SF buildable, $12.25 M total land value, and the weighted price per acre: $300 K/acre for lots 1 and 7, $265 K/acre for lots 2–6 and 8, resulting in an average of ~$284 K/acre).

## Fully Translated or Correct Sections

- **Hero headline and introduction:** The key message and supporting text are translated to Spanish, presenting the McAllen opportunity clearly. Stats below the hero (vacancy, pricing range, properties remaining, and cross‑border import share) are consistent with the corrected figures【213117336724707†screenshot】.
- **Executive summary and opportunity narrative:** Sections titled **“Resumen Ejecutivo”** and **“Oportunidad de Inversión Estratégica en McAllen”** are entirely in Spanish and correctly state the total portfolio ($12.25 M), acreage (43.17), buildable area (702,820 SF), and average price per acre (~$284 K)【59765568386788†screenshot】.
- **Market overview:** The analysis of market fundamentals, including vacancy around 3.9 % (3T24), 1.9–2.5 % rent growth, and cross‑border trade through the Pharr–Reynosa Bridge, is presented in Spanish with accurate data【238882101795360†screenshot】. The produce distribution table has been updated to sum roughly $6 B and is labelled in Spanish (Aguacates, Bayas, Pimientos, Cebollas, Otros)【75729635860527†screenshot】.
- **Investment highlights:** The list of cross‑border advantages, demographic strength, and strategic positioning is translated and uses correct numbers【59765568386788†screenshot】.
- **Prime land development & Military Highway sections:** These sections use Spanish titles and display correct portfolio metrics (43.17 acres, 702,820 SF, $284 K per acre)【198634677417967†screenshot】.
- **Demographic details:** The sub‑headings (Población, Ingreso Promedio del Hogar, etc.) and descriptive text are in Spanish; the narrative below summarising the 5‑mile demographics is also translated【394827944707209†screenshot】.
- **Industry insights (“Perspectivas de Expertos de la Industria”):** Video thumbnails and captions are labelled in Spanish, providing context for interest rate discussions and market outlooks【469384434825609†screenshot】.

## Sections Requiring Translation or Updates

1. **Land Investment card (hero):** The metric boxes (“Land Investment”, “Shovel‑Ready Industrial Parcels”, “Total Acres”, “Buildable SF”) remain in English despite the Spanish setting【213117336724707†screenshot】.
2. **Lot details and Professional Analysis cards:** For each lot (Lote 1 to Lote 8), the headings and subheadings (“Lot 03 – Professional Analysis”, “Site Coverage”, “Plan vs. Market‑Rate Analysis”) are still in English. These sections also still show outdated refrigerated warehouse costs and ROIs—for example, Lote 2 lists $19.89 M investment with a 6.8 % ROI instead of $17.23 M and ~8.3 % ROI【592305416081921†screenshot】.
3. **Portfolio investment strategy cards:** The tabs for Land Hold Strategy, Dry Warehouse Development, and Refrigerated Development remain in English and display slightly inaccurate totals (Dry: $117.7 M vs. $117.2 M, ROI 7.6 %; Refrigerated: $188 M vs. $189.1 M, ROI 6.9 %)【553615417232500†screenshot】.
4. **Professional Investment Analysis section:** The entire section (Investment Scenarios, Risk Assessment, Due Diligence) remains untranslated and carries the same mis‑numbered totals【387806208338496†screenshot】.
5. **Strategic investment analysis (Valley Advantage, Protection):** Bullet lists describing regional advantages and risk protection are still in English【723547713437816†screenshot】.
6. **Investment process & RE/MAX team:** The step‑by‑step process (“Initial Property Inquiry”, “Site Visit & Inspection”, etc.) and the agent bio are in English【264226968996508†screenshot】.
7. **Demographic card titles:** The top labels “1 Mile Radius”, “3 Mile Radius”, and “5 Mile Radius” are still in English. Translating them to “Radio de 1 milla”, etc., would provide full localization【394827944707209†screenshot】.

## Functionality Observations

- **Buttons and toggles:** The language toggle works as expected; navigation anchors and call‑to‑action buttons (“Ver Análisis”, “Exportar Hoja de Detalles”) function correctly. External video links open properly.
- **Navigation and layout:** The navigation bar reflects Spanish section names and scrolls to the appropriate sections. The layout remains consistent across translations.
- **Accessibility and meta:** Some alt text and ARIA labels remain in English and may need updating. Ensuring color contrast and proper heading structure will enhance accessibility.

## Recommendations

- **Complete the translation:** Translate remaining English elements (cards, headings, bullet lists, and the investment process) to Spanish. Use consistent translations for terms like “pricing per acre” (“precio por acre”) and “buildable area” (“área edificable”).
- **Update refrigerated investment numbers:** Replace the outdated construction costs and ROIs with the correct values ($15.16–$19.40 M per lot and ROI ~8 % for refrigerated development). Adjust the total portfolio figures accordingly.
- **Standardize metrics across pages:** Ensure all sections use the correct totals (43.17 acres, 702,820 SF, $12.25 M portfolio, $284 K average price/acre). Confirm that lots 1 & 7 are the only ones priced at $300 K/acre, with the remainder at $265 K/acre.
- **Improve accessibility:** Translate alt text, unify heading levels, and ensure proper ARIA roles in both language versions.

Addressing these items will deliver a polished and fully localized Spanish version of the investment page, enhancing credibility and ease of understanding for Spanish‑speaking investors.
